The solution lies in correctly implementing the custom retain, release, and retainCount methods.  Always call `[super retain]`, `[super release]`, and ensure `retainCount` accurately reflects the object's overall reference count.  Here's a corrected implementation:

```objectivec
@implementation FixedSubclass
- (id)retain {
  [super retain];
  return self;
}

- (oneway void)release {
  [super release];
}

- (NSUInteger)retainCount {
  return [super retainCount];
}
@end
```
By ensuring the superclass methods are called appropriately, we maintain the correct reference count and prevent memory management issues.
