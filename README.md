This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to overriding the retain, release, and retainCount methods within subclasses when using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). Incorrectly overriding these methods can lead to memory leaks or crashes. The `BuggySubclass.m` file showcases the problematic implementation, while `FixedSubclass.m` provides the corrected version.
