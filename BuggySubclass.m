In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can occur due to the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods in subclasses.  If a subclass overrides `retain`, `release`, or `retainCount` without meticulously adhering to the rules of memory management, it can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, failing to call `[super retain]` in a custom `retain` method will prevent the superclass from properly managing its reference count, leading to premature deallocation or retain cycles.
